Given an array arr[ ] of length N consisting cost of N toys and an integer K depicting the amount with you. Your task is to find maximum number of 
toys you can buy with K amount. 

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 7 
K = 50
arr[] = {1, 12, 5, 111, 200, 1000, 10}
Output: 4
Explaination: The costs of the toys 
you can buy are 1, 12, 5 and 10.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3 
K = 100
arr[] = {20, 30, 50}
Output: 3
Explaination: You can buy all toys.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function toyCount() which takes the integer N, integer K and the array
 arr[ ] as input parameters and returns the maximum count of toys you can have.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 = N = 105
1 = K, arr[i] = 109
