Contribution Title: "Connecting to a SQLite Database using moor in Dart"

 Introduction:

In this contribution, we'll demonstrate how to connect to a SQLite database using the moor package in Dart. 
This is a fundamental aspect of working with databases in Dart, and it's particularly useful for mobile and desktop applications.
We'll cover setting up the moor package, creating a simple database, inserting data, and querying data from the database.

*/

// Code Example:


import 'package:moor/moor.dart';
import 'package:moor/ffi.dart';

// Define a data class to represent a table in the database
@DataClassName('Task')
class Tasks extends Table {
  IntColumn get id => integer().autoIncrement()();
  TextColumn get description => text().withLength(min: 1, max: 50)();
}

// Create a database class that extends _$AppDatabase
@UseMoor(tables: [Tasks])
class AppDatabase extends _$AppDatabase {
  // The constructor takes an executor, which can be QueryExecutor or a LazyDatabase
  AppDatabase(QueryExecutor e) : super(e);

  @override
  int get schemaVersion => 1;
}

void main() async {
  // Open a connection to a database file (SQLite in this case)
  final database = AppDatabase(VmDatabase.memory());

  // Insert a task into the database
  final task = TasksCompanion(
    description: Value('Sample Task'),
  );
  final taskId = await database.into(database.tasks).insert(task);

  // Query tasks from the database
  final tasks = await database.select(database.tasks).get();

  // Print the tasks
  for (final task in tasks) {
    print('Task ${task.id}: ${task.description}');
  }

  // Close the database connection
  await database.close();
}
// Explanation:
/*
We use the moor package to create a database with a Tasks table that represents a list of tasks.
The AppDatabase class extends _$AppDatabase and sets the schema version to 1.
In the main function, we create an in-memory database using VmDatabase.memory(). In a real application, you'd specify a file path.
We insert a task into the database and query all tasks from the database, printing their details.
Finally, we close the database connection.


Conclusion:

Connecting to a SQLite database in Dart with the moor package is a crucial skill for building database-driven applications. 
This contribution provides a basic example to get you started. You can adapt and expand upon this code to suit your specific project needs.
