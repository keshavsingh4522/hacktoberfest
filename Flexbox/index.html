            JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at
            Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme, and Self.
            The creators of JavaScript wanted to borrow concepts from other
            programming languages, such as Java and C. Those of you with
            backgrounds in other languages may see things that look very
            familiar, mainly the use of classes and Object-Oriented Programming
            (OOP) architecture. Keep in mind that JavaScript is not a true OOP
            language and many things you may be familiar with from another
            language won’t work with JavaScript
          </p>

              JavaScript is considered a ‘loosely’ typed language, in which
              types do exist, but they are not enforced. You do not have to
              declare a type when creating a variable or an array, for instance.

            <h4>Why Put the Java in JavaScript?</h4>
            <p>
              When Eich created JavaScript in 1995, he created it for Netscape
              Navigator and it quickly became known as LiveScript. In another
              quirk of JavaScript history, the team changed the name to
              JavaScript to reflect Netscape's support of Java within its
              browser. While this definitely sounds confusing (and yes, it
              confuses people to this day), at the time people said it was a
              “marketing tactic” to connect a brand new language (JavaScript) to
              a popular language at the time (Java), even though JavaScript and
              Java have almost nothing to do with each other. The way Eich saw
              it, higher-end programmers used Java and it might be considered a
              “component language.” Eich created JavaScript to fill the need for
              a “glue language” used by informal programmers and designers. This
              allowed programmers to use JavaScript to put together components
              and automate interactions. There were two dominating web browsers
              at this point in our JavaScript history: Netscape Navigator (with
              JavaScript) and Internet Explorer (with Jscript). And by the time
              the browser world shifted and Internet Explorer became the
              dominant browser, JavaScript evolved into the endorsed standard
              for writing interactive processing run in a web browser.

            <h4>JavaScript Today</h4>
            <p>
              Today, JavaScript is still everywhere — it’s the most commonly
              used client-side scripting language. JavaScript is written into
              HTML documents and enables interactions with web pages in many
              unique ways. For example, thanks to JavaScript we can
              automatically schedule appointments and play online games.
              Furthermore, new developments, such as Node.js, allow JavaScript
              on the server-side while APIs, such as HTML5, allow user media
              control and other device features.
