# Deploy-Machine-Learning-Model-into-AWS-Cloud-Servers

This aims at how to build a spam detector using machine learning & launch it as a serverless API using AWS Elastic Beanstalk technology. We will be using the Flask python framework to create the API, basic machine learning methods to build the spam detector & AWS desktop management console to deploy the spam detector into the AWS cloud servers.

The processes involved are as follows:
1. Create a Flask application
2. Create a RESTful API - GET/POST Method
3. Build a spam detector ML model
4. Build a spam detector API
5. Launch an AWS EC2 instance(Virtual Server) using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
6. Deploy your ML model(API) into AWS virtual servers.
