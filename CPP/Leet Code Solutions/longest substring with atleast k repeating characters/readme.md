#  Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

## Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

- Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

- Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 105
