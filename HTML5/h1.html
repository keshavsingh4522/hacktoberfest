    <h1>Java (programming language)<p>Java is a High Level,
            class-based,
            object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
            possible.
            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once,
            run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without
            the need for recompilation</p>

    <h2>Swift (programming language)<p>Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language
            developed by Apple Inc.
            and the open-source community, first released in 2014.
            Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C
            had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s
            and lacked modern language features.

    <h3>C++<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup
            as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
            The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and
            functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
            It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers,
            including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many
            platforms.</p>

    <h4>Python (programming language)<p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
            Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical
            code for small and large-scale projects.[29]
            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
            It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented
            and functional programming.
            Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[30]

    <h5>C Sharp (programming language)<p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language
            encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,
            object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines</p>

    <h6>SQL<p>SQL ; Structured Query Language)[5] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for
            managing data
            held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data
            stream management system (RDSMS).
