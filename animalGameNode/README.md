This is a terminal based game, afterwards I'll make it into a browser based game.

To run this, download the zip or clone it and extract it.
install nodejs on your machine - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Then open a terminal(mac) or command prompt(windows)
navigate to the folder in your terminal using the "cd" command.
Or
### For windows - 
```just open the folder and press shift+rightclick -> open command prompt here.```

### For mac -
```Head into System Preferences and select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Find "New Terminal at Folder" in the settings and click the box. Now, when you're in Finder, just right-click a folder and you're shown the option to open Terminal.```


### When you're in the terminal, run this command- 
```node main.js```

Thank you.
