# Array
- An array is a collection of similar type items stored at contiguous memory locations.  This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array. The base value is index 0 and the difference between the two indexes is the offset. 
- In python array is implemented using list data structure.

## Aim
To implement Array data structure in Python.


## Purpose
The purpose is to create an data structure to array and demonstrate the operations.


## Short Description
Array:
- An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.
- In the code I have used array module to create arrays and performed operations on then.


## Workflow of the Project
- Under Array Operations --> Array_operations.py python script file is present. This file is the main python program file which contails the code.
- I have initially created a array of integer type and performed operations on the same. The operation are creating, adding element and deleting element using the built in methods.

* The Array Operations,
    - Operations,
        - append(), 
            - Method used to input element to the end of array.
        - insert(), 
            - Method used to input element in to a specific location of the array.
        - pop(), 
            - Method used to pop element at a particular location of the array. 

        - remove(), 
            - Method used to remove a particular element in an array. 
         
 ## Output:
Test case 1:
- Lets create an array of size 3

- Operation 1 printing the array created

- Operation 2 Adding Integer element to array using append  
    - We are adding 4 to array
<img src="../Array Operations/Images/Output1_part3.png">

- Operation 3 Adding Integer element to array using insert
    - We are adding 5 to index 2 of array 
<img src="../Array Operations/Images/Output1_part4.png">

- Operation 4 removing Integer element from array using pop
    - We are removing the element at index 2
<img src="../Array Operations/Images/Output1_part5.png">

- Operation 5 removing Integer element from array using remove
    - We are removing the element 2
<img src="../Array Operations/Images/Output1_part6.png">

- Operation 6 exit
