# Invisibility Cloak
Create your very own invisibility cloak using python's opencv package.

## Features:
* It works based on background detection and colour detection.
* You can adjust the colours of the cloak by changing the H values of the lower and upper red limits. In this code we have taken red coloured cloak so the value is from 10-170.
* For the colour codes or the HSV values of green and blue colours refer the web. Green starts from 120-180.
* You can adjust the saturation and brightness values by changing the S and V values.
* First show the webcam towards the background as it is the mask1 of the code and then show the cloak as it the mask 2 of the code.
* The code is basically the superimposition of the 2 images.

## Pre-requisites:
* Python3 installed
* Opencv package installed
* Numpy package installed
