# Pathfinding Visualizer

This application shows a vivid view of the route different algorithms take
while finding path from a start point to end point.

To use the app, just run the main.py file, and select the start and end point using
the left mouse button. Then you can add barriers across the entire grid and press the
'SPACE BAR'. The terminal will prompt you to choose which algorithm to run,
For dijsktra - Press 1
For A\* - Press 2
The visualizer will start and you will see the path it takes along the way.
