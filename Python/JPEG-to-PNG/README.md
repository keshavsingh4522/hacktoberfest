# JPEG-to-PNG

## Library used:PIL

With the help of this code , jpeg images can be coverted to png images.
I just used the library called PIL to do this.
The code is super readable , small and clear.
The best way to get the result is to use terminal or command line to run this program. Just type the name of the folder that contains all the images of jpeg format with a slash sign and then type the name of the folder or directory you want to save the png images into.
