// DSA using Java - Recursion
// Recursion refers to a technique in a programming language where a function calls itself. The function which calls itself is called a recursive method.

// Characteristics
// A recursive function must posses the following two characteristics

// Base Case(s)

// Set of rules which leads to base case after reducing the cases.

// Recursive Factorial
// Factorial is one of the classical example of recursion. Factorial is a non-negative number satisfying following conditions.

// 0! = 1

// 1! = 1

// n! = n * n-1!

// Factorial is represented by "!". Here Rule 1 and Rule 2 are base cases and Rule 3 are factorial rules.

// As an example, 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6

private int factorial(int n)
{
   // base case
   if (n == 0)
   {
      return 1;
   }
   else
   {
      return n * factorial(n - 1);
   }
}
// Recursive Fibonacci Series
// Fibonacci Series is another classical example of recursion. Fibonacci series a series of integers satisfying following conditions.

// F0 = 0

// F1 = 1

// Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

// Fibonacci is represented by "F". Here Rule 1 and Rule 2 are base cases and Rule 3 are fibonnacci rules.

// As an example, F5 = 0 1 1 2 3

// RecursionDemo.java

// Factorial of 5: 120
// Fibbonacci of 5: 0 1 1 2 3
